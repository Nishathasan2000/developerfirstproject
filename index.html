            <p>You are launching a knowledge base website like Wikipedia, then you get a lot of visitors. So you should
                buy
                a good hosting that can hold many visitors at the same time without slowing or crashing the site. Google
                loves original content. After 2022 Googleâ€™s broad core algorithm update and Google brain search results
                dominate, definitely the Wiki like good content with reference sites get higher ranks without any SEO..!

                <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                    CSS
                    and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
                    directly.
                    The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
                    the
                    front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how
                    the
                    field is developing.</p>

                <p>A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which,
                    together,enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place</p>
